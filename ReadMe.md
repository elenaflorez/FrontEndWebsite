# Front-end Web Design: Project 1
This website is a remix of the Contour 556 website for the Canberra Art Biennial. Aside from displaying the required coding techniques, the aim of this redesign was to enhance the clarity of the website's purpose. 
## Low Fidelity Prototype
The main design changes to the website were what content is included on the home page. The first text on the page is 'Canberra's Biennial Public Art Festival' - a to the point explanation of what the event is since the name Contour 556 was replaced. Although there is a call back to the original name with the title banner being a hand drawing of the topographical contour lines of Lake Burley Griffin (Contour 556), National Arboretum (Contour 656), and University of Canberra (Contour 606).

Since the event is about art I wanted to centre on the three artists commissioned for the event. The next thing users see after the title banner is images introducing the artists. Users can also gain more information about the artists by hovering over the image. 

When assessing the design on different scales the biggest change I made was to alter the artist images to appear from horizontal to vertical on smaller screens. In addition to this I made the text size change in relation to the screen size. 

These design changes are all reflected in the low fidelity prototypes shown below;

 <img
    src="Images/LF1.jpg"
    alt="Low Fidelity Prototype 1"
    />
     <img
    src="Images/LF2.jpg"
    alt="Low Fidelity Prototype 1"
    />
     <img
    src="Images/LF3.jpg"
    alt="Low Fidelity Prototype 1"
    />
     <img
    src="Images/LF4.jpg"
    alt="Low Fidelity Prototype 1"
    />

The low fidelity prototype was almost entirely implemented in the website. The main change is the navigation bar being visible rather than hidden in a drop down menu. The navigation only changes to a drop down menu when the screen is a smaller size to further show the responsiveness. I also decided not to add the donate button as I ran out of time. 

## Challenges 
## Possible Improvements
Some improvements could certainly be made to the simplicity and cleanliness of my code. Given more time I would have also liked to code more pages of the website redesign rather than just the home page. 

The website would have also benefitted from some further styling with different fonts and colours.
