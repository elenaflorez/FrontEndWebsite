                <p class="about_p">Alison Alder will collaborate with eight artists and the staff  from Hands On Studio to develop a series of text-based  banners, HIT PRINT! will provide the group 
                    of artists with an opportunity to reflect on ways the pandemic has impacted upon their lives. The collaborative exploration will prompt the artists to generate a series 
                    of prints based on their individual experiences with a collective overall outcome. </p>
                <p class="about_p">The works created will be digitally enlarged and printed onto up to three  banners on durable material and hung from sites in the parliamentary triangle. The banners will be 
                    accessible for the public to view in August 2022. Whilst the work is on display, the artists will host a live spoken-word performance at the site. </p>

                Alison Alder is a visual artist whose work blurs the line between studio, community and social/political art practice. Primarily known for her political screen prints, Alison also uses animation, video and constructed environments to make her point. 
                
            </p>
            <p class="about_p">
                Her formative years were spent working in the screen-printing workshops of Megalo and Redback Graphix and the next major period of her art practice was spent working within Indigenous organisations in the Northern Territory before moving back to NSW and the ACT. Alison received an International Year of Tolerance Fellowship from the Australia Council in recognition of her work toward social justice and equity through art practice.
    
            </p>
            <p class="about_p">
                Her work has been exhibited in several key Australian exhibitions including, amongst others, Know My Name at the National Gallery of Australia, Making It New: Focus on Contemporary Australian Art at the Museum of Contemporary Art (Sydney), and See You at the Barricades at the Art Gallery of NSW.
    Her work is held in major Australian public collections including the National Gallery of Australia, most State galleries, numerous regional galleries and the Australian War Memorial as well as private collections including the Cruthers Collection of Women’s Art and the Kerry Stokes Collection. In the USA her work is held in the collections of the Centre for the Study of Political Graphics, the Interference Archive and the New York Public Library Print Collection.
    
            </p>
            <p class="about_p">
                Alison is currently an Honorary Associate Professor at the ANU School of Art and Design and Library Associate at The Australian Parliamentary Library where she has been undertaking research for a series of screen prints focussing on the legacy of Australian Prime Ministers from 1930 – 1950, following her exhibition One to Eight at the Museum of Australian Democracy. Alison is also working on a major project with the National Portrait Gallery which will be released in 2023.
